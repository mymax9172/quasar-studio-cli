# Quasar Studio CLI

Quasar Studio CLI is the way-yo-go tool to use Quasar Studio properly

## Installation of Quasar Studio CLI (clone git repository)

Quasar Studio CLI must be installed just once (and globally)

1. `$ git clone ....`
2. Change your directory to the Quasar directory
3. `$ npm install`
4. `$ npm link`

From now on, call qstudio from any folder that contains a Quasar application to use the CLI
